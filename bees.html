        <h2 style= "font-family: Arial;">North American Bees</h2>
        <p>
            Native bees are an unappreciated treasure, with 4,000 species from tiny
            Perdita to large carpenter bees, they can be found anywhere in North
            America where flowers bloom. Most people don't realize that there were
            no honey bees in America until the white settlers brought hives
            from Europe. These resourceful insects promptly managed to escape
            domestication, forming swarms and setting up housekeeping in hollow
            trees, other cavities or even exposed to the elements just as they
            had been doing in their native lands. Native pollinators, in particular
            bees, had been doing all the pollination in this continent before the
            arrival of that import from the Old World. They continue to do a great
            deal of it, especially when it comes to native plants.

        <h2 style="font-family: Arial;">Why they are dying and why it's bad for us</h2>
        <p>
            They are in serious and immediate risk from human-caused climate change.
            The impacts are large and they are underway.  The number of invertebrate
            pollinathtml font family listuts and oils. Without these pollinators,"many of us would no
            longer be able to enjoy coffee, chocolate and apples, among many other
            foods that are part of our daily lives," said Simon Potts,
            Ph.D., one of the study's authors and a biodiversity professor at the
            University of Reading.
